Brookstone Homes has been the choice of thousands of discerning homeowners in the Houston area for decades. John Wawrose, founder and president, personally supervises the construction of every home. He builds only a couple dozen homes a year, so he can give his customers the advice and attention to detail they\'re looking for. He can help you design your home from scratch or use your ideas to craft the home you envision.
"I try to take the worry out of designing and building your home. I think it should be fun for the customer," John says.
John has been building homes since 1980, a couple years after he graduated from Rice University with a degree in Civil Engineering. He started Brookstone Homes in 1987 and is one of Houston\'s most established and experienced custom homebuilders. He\'s left his biggest mark on neighborhoods inside the Loop and others centrally located, building more than 200 homes in Bellaire, West University, Braes Heights, and River Oaks alone. More than 100 of his homes were designed by famed architect Lucian Hood.
Homes built by Brookstone Homes range from about 2,500 to nearly 10,000 square feet, from several hundred thousand dollars to multi-million.
"I think I have reached the point where most of my customers know somebody I\'ve built a home for," John says. That attests to the satisfaction and loyalty of his customers.
Brookstone Homes knows what today\'s homebuyer needs for practicality, comfort, and style for a home to retain value and turn into a solid investment for the future. ',

Communication
One of the most important aspects of the building process is communication. It helps us ensure the integrity of your new home, whether it is you, our valued customer, or the many engineers, manufacturers, contractors, and inspectors we work with.

No Surprises
You have the right to know exactly what materials and specifications will be utilized in the building of your custom home, so we urge all of our customers to thoroughly read Kurk Homes Features and Specifications booklet. We also want to be very clear to our Build on Your Lot customers about any areas which may add costs to the construction process since every lot size and topography is different.

Flexibility
Kurk Homes offers you flexibility not found with large Build on Your Lot companies. We actually enjoy the challenge and take pride in the one-on-one relationships between builder and homeowner that is lacking in the production home arena. You are encouraged to make changes that suit your needs and desires. By properly planning and documenting these changes, we avoid lengthy delays in the construction of your new home.

No Short Cuts
Kurk Homes will strive to build your new home as quickly as possible, but we wont cut corners or sacrifice quality. We take the time to ensure that your home is built just the way you want it from start to finish. Our meticulous inspection process even includes a T.R.E.C. code certified inspector for the final walk through.',

With Rods keen business knowledge and Jean Anns innovative approach to sales, marketing and architecture, 13 homes were sold in the first month of operation during one of the toughest real estate markets the nation has seen to date. Highland quickly grew to become one of the leading single-family homebuilders in the United States. Today, we build over 2800 homes a year in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, Texas.

Rod and Jean Anns commitment to quality and customer satisfaction has earned Highland many industry awards, including consistent high rankings by J.D. Power and Associates, making the top 20 in The Builder 100 List and winning the Peoples Choice Builder of the Year award for the 4th consecutive time. Though these accolades are wonderful, our top honor comes through referrals from homeowners as well as Realtors who continually sell Highland Homes.

At Highland we consider our talented team of associates an extension of our family, and were ranked sixth by Texas Monthlys 50 Best Companies to Work for in Texas.

Highland was built on a solid foundation of core values and guiding principles, an approach that has kept us in business through considerable real estate fluctuation. This long-term financial success is just another reason why Highland Homes can offer security to our homeowners. At a time when many major banks were tightening their lending requirements, Highland secured over half a billion dollars in lines of credit, a strong indicator of stability. In fact, a Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo said,

In my view, Highland is one of the best run homebuilders in our market today. Highlands commitment to conservative financial stewardship means that they will be there in the future for their homebuyers, lenders and employees.

Highland is an employee owned company, dedicated to providing the best possible homebuilding and home buying experience. Over 30 years later, were still a family-owned and operated company, dedicated to providing the best possible homebuilding and home buying experience. You can be certain that Highland Homes remains committed to our mission statement of delivering homes we are proud of and ensuring each Highland homeowner realizes their American Dream.',

She wanted a company that built relationships and gave back to the community. She wanted a company that loved the Austin area as much as she did (and still does).
Four years later that company officially became Moreland Properties. Since those early beginnings, Moreland has sustained a pattern of solid growth, going from two agents in one location to over75 agents in threelocations. Referrals and repeat business from satisfied clients has fueled this rapid growth. Although Emily still plays an integral role in the day-to-day operations of the business, most of her time is spent supporting her agents and their clients\' needs.',

Practicing side by side in the same office for over 25 years, both brothers have had their own firms, Prozign Architects and Scientech Engineers respectively. Additionally, over the past six years, both owned separate luxury home building companies, Prozign Builders and Belmont Builders. Recently, the brothers have decided to join their companies into one single entity known as Concord Builders. The company is committed to excellence in both the design and construction of luxury homes.

Currently, Concord is working on several multi-million dollar properties in the Memorial Villages and River Oaks. These projects are in different phases of the design and construction process. The following are in the planning and design phase, under construction, or completed.

Site Selection is a carefully planned process that Concord Builders prides as the groundwork of its Residential Development operation. We begin the selection process with careful market and location research. The selection phases of the developments are based on specific criteria refined through experience and ability to find our unique sites. Each lot is chosen with the consideration of its relative location within some of Houstons most beautiful neighborhoods. The location and quality of the neighborhood is just as important as the specific location within the community. Some of the specific details which we look for include street location, neighbor adjacency, shape and size, tree canopy and districting. Lots that afford a quality of life provide the perfect setting for a place that will hold a home with the same value and character.

Custom Sites are welcomed by Concord Builders, specialty construction is our expertise and when a client brings a pre-selected lot to us we will gladly work with them to achieve their vision for a Custom Home.',

He founded his own firm, Neuffer Homes and Development in 1986 and his custom home division, Legacy Custom Homes, and Silverado, his excavation company soon followed.

Neuffers work was innovative, being the first to bring energy efficient homes on a production basis into the Northern Nevada housing market. Neuffer Homes soon earned the prestigious Northern Nevada Builder of the Year Award.

While head of one of the regions largest and most successful construction companies, Neuffer built over 2000 homes ranging from entry level to luxury estates.
In 2001 Mike made the decision to pursue another passion, winemaking, and founded Nicholas Cole Cellars,  building, developing and planting 268 acres of vineyard winery and residential properties in Walla Walla, WA.

During his years as a businessman in Nevada, Neuffer volunteered and built two homes for Habitat for Humanity, served on various boards including the Reno Opera, and sponsored two of the local elementary schools. Mike continued to invest in his community when he moved to Eastern Washington to build his winery and vineyard.

There he was a founding member of Walla Walla Valleys sustainable farming organization, Vinea, and a major donor to the Walla Walla Community College Viticulture and Enology building.

Mike has also supported and donated to Seattle Childrens Hospital, arts and education programs, and other causes.

Early in 2010, enthusiastic about what he saw as a change in the needs of todays home buyers and the monumental shift in residential construction, Mike was drawn back into the building industry and founded Domus Homes. His vision was to craft high quality, affordable homes geared toward first time home buyers and families in established community settings. Taking into consideration the adjusted priorities of families and embracing the urban lifestyle desired by todays home buyers, it is the goal of Domus Homes to redefine quality and value when it comes to affordability.

We use Acme bricks, tech shield decking, paneled doors, rounded corners, high ceilings, lots of arches, fireplaces, covered patios, and more.

We want to be a part of the lives of people, to truly connect, with people in all aspects of our world including employees, vendors, tradespeople, customers and their families. It is all about people.

With over 45 years combined management experience, we listen to our customers, and deliver a home that is "simply better" than our competition.

After all, shouldnt you know how your home is being built?
Heavenly Homes knows that the complexities of todays homes are extensive and building to suit all the specific needs of our clients is our top priority. Custom features such as, media rooms, smart homes, safe rooms, wine grottos, and elevators are just a few common features people are requesting in their custom homes today. President of Heavenly Homes, Rory Caton, knows the importance of these custom features and will be assisting you throughout the design, budgeting, and overall construction process. After receiving individual honors in his Construction Science degree, Rory graduated Cum Laude from the College of Architecture at Texas A & M University. Since childhood, he has been fascinated with how and why things work. I love looking at everything from a small patio to a multi-storied building, analyzing how the form of the structure affects the function, and what could have been done to make it better, whether functionally or aesthetically. Rory has been blessed with an ability to take geometric shapes and combine them into something that is not only pleasing to the eye, but satisfies the reason for its creation. Now he has taken that natural ability and honed it over time to create wonderful living spaces for every familys needs here at Heavenly Homes.

Al Rahm has been building custom homes for over 30 years. Sunrise Custom Homes are super efficient, airtight, top quality homes, and utilize green technology and standards throughout, wherever possible.

We specifically pay attention to the flow of the home so that traffic areas do not interfere with hang out zones. Natural light by way of windows and skylights should harmonize the surrounding landscape with the interior of the home. Interior lighting should create a pleasant or dramatic mood without glaring effects.

Some technical Building Ideas that we emphasize in our homes and suggest to our clients are:

Footings and Foundations should be soil tested and designed in a way that no settling will occur.
Non Toxic Building Materials should be researched in place of many commonly used and potentially carcinogenic industry standards.
Breathability is very important to a home so that mold and mildew, as a result of condensation and moisture forming inside of the walls, does not occur.
Radiant Floor Heat is 60% more efficient than convective heat and provides more than 3 times the comfort and enjoyment.
Polyiconene Insulation is state of the art, air tight, and gives off no hazardous gases or fiberglass fragments like conventional insulation.
Radiant Barriers reflect heat before it ever enters the structure of the home and reduces utility bills by using natural methods of convection to keep the home cool.

His story illustrates how small businesses that stay within their means can become a success.
You hear all the time about people living above their needs, said James Evans, the director of the University of Houston Small Business Development Center.
The same principal applies in business. It takes a lot of discipline to operate within your means and to keep your profit margins.
And Tavor seems to have that discipline.
Fed up with the cold Philadelphia winters, he moved to Houston in 1979 and landed a job with an air-conditioning company for about six months before starting one of his own. He said that the contractors he worked for constantly asked him for advice when he was installing air-conditioning systems for them.
Basically, I used to design the homes, and one day I decided why shouldnt I just start my own business? Tavor said. And I started building homes.
Tavor started by building a home and living in it. He sold that home for a profit and repeated the process twice. He always used the money he made to invest in his company. Today, Tavor builds about six or seven homes a year.',

During the early years, they dedicated themselves strictly to building homes on finished lots. As they grew and learned what the customer wanted, they expanded their operation from only home construction to becoming vertically integrated and involved in land acquisitions, platting, road construction, installation of water and sewer systems, home construction and in-house marketing and sales.

They have purchased sufficient land to develop over 1,700 residential lots in four separate subdivisions. This gives them the ability to plan an entire subdivision from the beginning so that each community may include items their customers are looking for such as larger lots, convenient location and quality construction.

Texas Home Development\'s intent is to offer products that appeal to a broad cross section of the market, ranging from first time home buyers to active life styles and upper-end luxury home buyers.

But out of that diversity rose a man who achieved success andunderstood the value of doing things right. Living such contrast helped him to quickly recognize thepolarity of most everything: good/bad, quality/short-cuts, integrity/compromise, truth/lies,promises/fakers.
He started his own business at the age of 28 with $200 in his pocket. He took a lot of chances but knewtrue north and stuck to that moral compass. He made promises and kept them. He sold quality and hedelivered. He grew his little company to one of the largest and most respected in Texas.
While he was building a successful company, he also built his own home. A home unlike any other in hisneighborhood, in the area or even in the city. It was unique in depth of detail and quality. It was unique inthe amount of thought and synergy it produced  every element was hand selected or custom designed tocreate a certain personality  it was a co-creation between vision, inspiration and love.

He knew heloved to create, he knew he was passionate about quality and value and he knew Houston was the mostvital, prosperous city in the country and that it was gaining more respect and appreciation each year.
So he created Al Ross Luxury Homes in the finest areas in Houston. He wanted others to experience luxury,value and quality beyond anything they ever had before.

Marks passion and understanding of Architectural styles combined with historical narrative are rarely available to most residential home buyers. His influence is everywhere and our client meetings are fascinatingly educative, creating an enjoyable project environment with unique opportunities for our clients.
Marks passion was to bring the build quality and elegance of these unique homes to the American market and make them available not just to the exclusive custom home buyer but to all who desire a standard of home and living that is currently not served in the conventional real estate market.
Mark is very visible in community life and our company. He is a frustrated soccer player (having never had the talent to be good) and supports local schools, charities, activities and sports teams across Montgomery County and Greater Houston. Our corporate function is to serve and our community spirit is the same. Please contact us to find out more about who we are.',

He then went on to study construction management and received a prestigious designation of Real Property Administrator (RPA) from the Building Owners and Managers Institute. In January of 2011, Menny Rosenbaum joined forces with Philip Robbins, formerly of Levitt & Robbins Custom Homes. Philip earned his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics from the University of Texas. In 2001, he received the Bellaire Citizen of the Year Award, and served on the Bellaire Drainage Citizens Advisory Task Force in 2003. Philip has shown his dedication to his community by building the 1996 ASID Designer Showhouse benefiting the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and Sunshine Kids of Houston, building the 75 Year Anniversary Home of the 90s for the AIA Home Tour in 1999, renovating the Bellaire Trolley Pavilion in 2000, and building the Bellaire High School Baseball/Softball Locker Room Facility.

Their knowledge, creativity and education, coupled with over 43 years of professional experience in all aspects of the building trades, bring an exceptional level of professionalism and commitment to each and every home they build.  With a personal involvement which starts with the design conception and carries all the way through to the finished product, Menny and Philips hands-on approach ensures the highest degree of quality and customer service. Together, Menny with Bentley Homes and Philip previously with Levitt & Robbins Custom Homes, have earned a combined 74 awards!

Menny and Philip live with their families in Bellaire, one of the communities in which they build. Many of their clients become friends after the construction of their new home! Their reputation is the most important thing! Its how the company gets new business.

It is no surprise that Bentley Homes has earned the reputation of being one of the premier builders in the area amongst their clients and other builders. Menny Rosenbaum and Philip Robbins operate every day on the belief that customer satisfaction, promptness and keeping promises are an integral part of doing business in the world today.

The philosophy of Bentley Homes is not how many homes we can build, but how well we can build them. We build a limited number of homes each year the old fashion way. We concentrate our efforts on the close personal attention to every detail, quality and style. Because Menny and Philip personally supervise the construction on a daily basis, Bentley Homes is able to pass on the cost savings, exceptional quality and personal touch to all their clients.

We will custom build anywhere in Houston, Bellaire, West University, South Side Place, Braes Heights, Braes Oaks, Afton Oaks, Meyerland, Meyerpark, Memorial, Tanglewood, Briargrove, Hunters Creek Village, River Oaks and in all surrounding neighborhoods.

Our guiding principals have been to give small company attention to our customers while building enough homes in each location to realize economies of scale and production line efficiencies. We now build from 150 to 200 homes each year, and intend to remain at that size in the future.
Our product has evolved to our present program of larger lots, all detached garages, with an emphasis on larger one-story homes. We are able to offer many changes to individualize the homes, and have developed an array of garage designs, including overhead storage and porte cocheres. We have a wide range of selections for such standard items as flooring, cabinets, counter tops, and brick.
Our pricing procedures are aimed at making the purchasing and upgrading decisions as easy as possible. Our list base price is our final price. You don\'t have to worry about being a great negotiator to get the best price. Our options and upgrades are priced at reasonable rates, so that we are not interested in promoting them to make a profit. We feel that our homes, with standard features, provide everything you would expect in a finished home. The changes and upgrades simply reflect the fact that people\'s needs and wants will vary, and we try to accommodate them as smoothly as we can while still retaining production efficiencies.
Many of our customers currently have a home to sell. We recognize the problems that go along with selling a home without knowing where you are going to move, and the timing involved. At Cervelle Homes, we will contract with you to build the home of your choice with an earnest money deposit of $500.
If your home is not sold by the time your new home is at finishing stage, your earnest money will be refunded. Our experience is that this rarely happens. Even if it does, we have not had much problem selling the completed homes to people who don\'t have the time to wait for one to be built. ',

Active in his community as Race Director of the Heights Fun Run and serving on the Board of Directors of the Houston Heights Association,Damian is also a professional musician and an occasional ultra-runner.
Damian studied Musical performance and History at Loyola University New Orleans where he lived-in and fell in love with the pre-Civil War-era houses and landscapes of New Orleans\' Garden District. He went on to study Art History and architecture at Loyola University Chicagos Rome Center in Rome, Italy. This only deepened his appreciation for classic architecture and scale -while conveniently scratching an insatiable travel itch.
Damian oversaw his first construction project in 1998 in what is now a Historic District of the Houston Heights neighborhood. He continued developing residential projects in Houstons inner-loop, always in an effort to improve the historic and eclectic character of the neighborhoods he and his family call home. Damian took on his first full landscape design and install project in 2004, his first interior design commission in 2008 and oversaw the interior renovation of a landmark Houston home in 2013.
Today, dedicated to timeless luxury home development always avoiding the \'cookie-cutter, Damian and his team oversee every aspect of the development process from concept to design, finance to finished selections, architecture, interior and landscape design. This ensures that the final product lives up to their exacting standards and provides their clients a fully-integrated, well thought-out and elegant lifestyle experience.',

He formed his first company, Sure-Way Construction, Inc. with a partner in 1969 and built over 300 homes, two subdivisions and a dozen commercial buildings in the Houston area. After 11 years, the company was resolved due to growing interest rates that made new home buying difficult.
In 1980, Doug formed his second company, Chalet Properties, Inc. Although primarily a commercial and industrial venture in the US and overseas, Chalet Properties also provided some residential construction in the Nashville area. However, the early years were mostly industrial, working with companies like Reed Roller Bit, Reed Tubular, Baker Oil Tool, Baker-Hughes and Fina Oil Polypropylene. In the late 80s and early 90s, Chalet Properties was commissioned to build several commercial structures in Saudi Arabia, Peru, Guatemala and Belize, including government housing and employee housing.
In 1996, Dougs son came on board as parter in Chalet Construction, Inc. Doug Jr., like his father before him, also grew up in the construction business, working with different crews and gaining first-hand experience building. Doug Jr. attended Sam Houston State University with a focus in Construction Management. He also attended the University of Houston with a focus in Architectural & Environmental Design.
At Chalet Construction, our commitment to quality home construction ensures your quality of living.

The Commercial division of Miller-Valentine Group has built more than 83 million square feet of space and currently owns and manages a growing commercial portfolio of over six million square feet in a variety of sectors.
The Multifamily division has been developing, building and managing quality housing for more than 30 years, producing over15,000 multifamilyunits from urban neighborhood revitalization to luxury living.
We have grown through a commitment to quality and integrity, in both our buildings and our service standard for customers.
When we do business we bring a team of experts from different disciplines, so that you have all the information you need at one table.
The structure of the team is determined by your requirements and the specifics of your project. We shape our business to yours.
The core value of every team is sharing expertise and experience. For example, when a customer contracts with us to build a new facility, they may gain insight on re-zoning from our Development group or learn about tax incentive programs from our Finance team.
We do what we say we are going to do. Every Miller-Valentine Associate is an experienced, quality professional. Our team works to ensure that the budgets and contractual and management details will exceed your expectations.
We think like owners. Since Miller-Valentine owns more than 6 million square feet, we bring that perspective to your project.

Starting in 1974 with Hometowns first estate home, Bill and his associates have built homes for almost 1,500 of our neighbors. Since 1982, the Leigh team has built and sold more custom homes in our Hometown than the next two builderscombined.
A well built home, crafted to a familys expectations, does not occur by accident. The process takes years of experience and dedication to develop properly, and the Leigh companies have earned a justified reputation as the builder providing the best value in The Woodlands over the past 43 years.
Mr. Leigh and his wife were two of the pioneers in the Woodlands back in 1974, and they have been active in the communitys growth ever since. A licensed attorney, Bill served as The Woodlands first elected Trustee of the Conroe School District, Director-at-Large of the Montgomery County Hospital District, and founding Vice President of the Grogans Mill Village Association.
He helped charter the Woodlands Rotary Club and our Chamber of Commerce, and his wife helped establish The Woodlands Welcome Wagon, Interfaith Child Care Facility, Trinity Episcopal Church, our areas first PTA, and our hospital.
Bill Also holds the distinction of being one of a very few Graduate Master Builders in the Houston region. He and his team work with each family through the design, architectural, engineering, construction and decoration phases. They are personally involved in every stage of every home. The teams leadership and craftsmen (some going back over four decades) will help craft your dreams into a reality you will cherish for years to come.
As a result, Bills companies have been honored with awards, the likes of which most builders can only dream. In 1989, the Leigh team was selected as the first recipient of the coveted Pinnacle Award, presented by the Texas Association of Realtors to the best custom builder in the State of Texas. The Woodlands has named them as the Top Custom Builder in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2007.
But the highest award theyve consistently won has been the continued trust of an overwhelming number of new home buyersfriends who have charged Bill Leigh and his associates with responsibility to build their new home.',

I built over 400 homes in the process and then managed the construction of another 300 custom homes and townhomes as the co-owner of a development and construction company for 10 years specializing in Houstons inner loop and in-town neighborhoods.
Throughout those years, I have lived in four homes that I have built for myself, including our current house, and I am constantly thinking about how modern families live and what can be done in the design and construction process to improve the quality of my homeowners lives.
Greg and I have worked hard to define a company that would specialize in leveraging our combined passion for this great profession with a desire to maximize the quality of our own lives and that of our families through the way we work and what we do.

After learning the trade, Tom decided to go out on his own in 1972 and he placed an ad in the paper that read, Painting, Roofing, Remodeling and Additions. After several years of remodeling, Tom built two homes for himself which he then sold and used the profits for his first development in Colchester, Vermont. Tom truly enjoyed working with customers, allowing them to customize their homes exactly the way they wanted.
In 1980, Tom hired Paul Brogna as a laborer and he, too, learned the trade. Pauls skills allowed him to start coordinating the construction details for all of the homes as they were built. Paul became a full partner in the business in 1990 and since then, he is fully involved in every aspect of the construction process. Paul works closely with customers from the design of the homes, to selecting building products, to coordinating all of the labor and materials used on the construction of the home, as well as doing the final walk-through with the customers prior to closing. Paul also works with every customer after we sell a home to ensure their needs and concerns are met.
Since all customers work with Paul, and he deals directly with every vendor and contractor, there are few miscommunications. Customers consistently comment how smooth and enjoyable the construction process is when working with one primary person. Our home offerings range from higher end starter homes and spacious multi-family dwellings, to larger luxury single family homes. We have received awards on all of these housing levels from the NHBRA.
In 2005, Toms youngest son, Peter Sheppard, joined the team at Sheppard Custom Homes. Peters background as owner of Vermont Custom Electrical and Acoustic Interiors allowed him to easily transition into new home construction. He was able to take Sheppard Custom Homes to another level by allowing our customers to customize home audio video needs. Peter has now partnered with Sheppard Custom Homes as a Construction Coordinator.',

The process can seem overwhelming and frustrating at times. Patience, understanding, and a good source of information are key in planning, designing, and building your new custom home. The place to start is organizing your wants and needs for your new home. Write down your specific concerns or ideas that you can describe to your homes designer/builder. Then take the next step and create a profile on Houzz, the home design website that allows you to keep all your thoughts and ideas organized in one convenient place. Houzz lets you keep track of interior as well as exterior design ideas by saving specific photos into ideabooks, where you can make notes of colors and design
Write down all your thought and ideas about this project and the more organized you are the more accurate your project will be. Stay focused on the project when working on one area and put the project away when it becomes frustrating. Keep your thoughts organized and at your fingertips and this will help lower your level of frustration. Planning, designing and building should be an enjoyable experience for you if you take one step at a time and do not rush the planning and designing process. When working with your partner remember to compromise and be considerate of each others ideas and needs.

Leckhampton Homes represents over seventy years and three generations of home building experience. It has always been a Norwood tradition to provide families with the best quality home at the most affordable price.

The Norwood family began building homes in Houston in the 1950s, when homes were less than $10,000 and interest rates were a whopping 3%. The Norwoods began setting the pace to meet the growing demand for housing. They were the first builders to have model home parks and to furnish their models. The Norwoods also revolutionized the high standards of quality control for home building and community development. They were the first to build "master-planned communities." More than 23,000 home buyers enjoyed a solid investment with their home.

In 1990, the Greater Houston Builders Association honored the Norwoods as the pioneers of the home building industry as it is known today. It was also the year Steve Norwood chose to once again build affordable homes in the Houston area.

Exceeding your expectations is standard at Leckhampton Homes. Trust the experience of the family that revolutionized Houston home building.',

It addresses the personality that the home should have, from how the bathrooms should look and how the kitchen should function to what the overall feel of the home should be. This then leads to a Features Questionnaire which covers all aspects of construction and finish styles. This is where clients can comment on the kind of finishes or materials they desire, such as flooring, countertops and woodwork. This planning process is typically done in cooperation with a clients architect and/or interior designer.

The next stage has the Gabriel Home Builders team beginning to develop the clients dream home on paper, followed by a preliminary estimate that ensures the budget guidelines are being met. Once the plans are complete, the client is given a detailed estimate of costs along with a very detailed specification list, so that when it is time to start construction, the client is confident that GHB has left no stone unturned. Clients can move forward with the assurance that Gabriel Home Builders has paved the path for a successful building plan.

Once an agreement is reached on any new project, Gabriel Home Builders sends a courtesy letter to the clients immediate neighbors informing them of the upcoming construction start time, along with company contact information. This caring attention to detail and consideration for others has resulted in solid relationships wherever GHB builds.',

Alleanza is an Italian word for Covenant. When you share your dreams and your plans with us, we will make promises and commitments to you that we take seriously. We stand by each of our custom built homes in Houston with a lifetime guarantee. This is our covenant  our promise - to you and your family. We will do what we say were going to do, and well exceed your expectations every step of the way.


Alleanzas History
We started as custom home builders in Houston in 2007. All our homes have been distinguished by their design, custom features, and high quality. Our company started during an inconvenient economic period for real estate, but we knew that custom built homes in Houston had potential, and we knew we were the best at what we do. When you provide high quality and outstanding customer service, people will always want to work with you. Weve found that to be true, and by the end of 2017, we will have completed our 50th custom built home in Houston. Were proud of that, and were even expanding into communities like Sugarland and Richmond.


What Makes Alleanza Unique?
Our designs are unique, compared to other home builders in Houston. The architects we work with are talented and they design truly custom and high-end homes.

Our reputation for doing what we say we will do and standing behind our work is well established. Theres a lot of credibility associated with our name and our ability to create custom built homes in Houston. Weve been doing this for 10 years, and people know we can be trusted.

Our process is seamless for the future homeowner. We make it fun and managed and predictable. We are constantly communicating with you, your architect, and the entire construction team. Everything is transparent and predictable and the end result is exactly what you envisioned when we first started talking about your dream home. ',

He has worked in both the custom and production home-building industries where he has served as a builder, estimator, project manager and vice president of construction. A husband and father of 2 children, Mike enjoys the outdoors and spending time with his family. Mikes roots in Bolivar started in 1979 when his Aunt LaNell and Uncle Eddie Oehlers bought their first beach house in Gilchrist. Mike spent many summers and family holidays enjoying all that Bolivar had to offer. His Uncle Eddie always referred to the Bolivar peninsula as Gods Country. It was this sentiment that made rebuilding his familys beach home after hurricane Ike one of his most gratifying experiences. He now looks forward to building more Bolivar custom homes so he can share this love and experience with you and your family.',

Personal integrity, attention to detail and oversight of all phases of construction insure that buyers get a high quality home for a fair price.

Buying a home is one of lifes major events, says Mr. Gerhart. Buyers spend a lot money, time and emotion on purchasing a new home, they dont need any extra stress or uncertainty. They are our livelihood, so we dont take their concerns lightly.

Helping Mr. Gerhart is Charles Breazeale, an experienced homebuilder and remodeler from California who shares in Mr. Gerharts building philosophy and commitment to quality. Mr. Breazeale oversees day-to-day operations and can be found at each Advantage Homes project daily. Mr. Breazeale has held a California contractor\'s license since 2001. His attention to detail, knowledge of strict California codes and fresh west coast ideas helps ensure Advantage Homes remains a step above other area homebuilders.

My job is to make sure everything is done right, says Mr. Breazeale. Nothing less will do. Mr. Breazeale adds, As a homebuilder who wants their pride to show in their product, thats good enough or no one will know the difference is no excuse for poor quality or workmanship. We employ contractors who show personal pride in what they do and want to get it right just as much as we do. My commitment to you is, if its not right, I will make it right.

"You don\'t have to take our word that we build the best new homes in the area." Mr. Gerhart says. "Ask our homeowners. What they have to say about us and our homes is best advertisement we can have. Advantage Homes\' reputation as a quality home building company is very important to me!"

Since 2003, Advantage Homes has built more than 100 homes in the Montgomery County and Lake Conroe area. Recently completed projects featured in our "Exterior Photo Gallery" and "Interior Photo Gallery" demonstrate the high quality and timeless architectural designs offered by Advantage Homes.',

designations of Graduate Master Builder, Certified Graduate Remodeler, Graduate Master Remodeler, Certified Green Professional, EPA
Certified Lead Based Paint, Renovation, Repair and Painting Firm, and Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist. We have done this even though
the state and local government does not require builders or remodelers to have a license. Because of the effort we have taken to become a
complete professional in our line of work, clients feel secure in our abilities to take care of one of their largest investments: their homes.
There are very few companies throughout the country that possess these same qualifications.
We receive client requests for upgrades, or high-end jobs, that other construction companies are not qualified to complete due to their lack
of experience or knowledge. Throughout the years, our clienteles projects have reached a more refined level and it is our continued goal to
grow in this direction.
JRG Builder & Remodelers may grow but its integrity and reputation stays the same. Like all good companies, we continually improve all
aspects of our business. We look for better ways to cut down on material waste or recycle material for other uses. We try to develop
strategies to better preplan a stage of construction to raise our efficiency level. We continue to maintain an excellent customer service record

We built a small modest house at Treasure Island Subdivision between Galveston and Surfside . It was built by hand. Each weekend we used just a skill saw, hammer, and bags and bags of nails. We relied heavily on the expertise of our Dad, and friends with a variety of professional backgrounds.

As a life lesson, we learned what a little hard work, friends, and a lot of heart and determination could accomplish. Proving it is not work if you love what you do.

Paul and Tracy Speich have been working hard ever since to make the challenges of life a little more fun.

In 2006 we developed and built a service based business which focuses on listening to the expectations and dreams of our clients. As a family owned company, we appreciate all our clients and treat everyone as part of the family.

Tracy Comee Speich is a graduate of Texas A&M University, and managing partner of Speich Custom Homes, L.L.C., specializing in Human resources and accounting.

Paul Speich is a product of the University of Houston, and received his Professional Home Inspectors certificate from Tomball College. Back ground is construction, AutoCAD, and Chief Architect. ',

From the beginning of the project, the company is able to design around the budget, and design details and changes can be implemented with ease during construction, with Ray and his staff overseeing the entire process. Superintendents walk through every project with Ray  through each stage of the project, from the laying of the foundation to sheet rocking, to the finishing details.
Due to the full control of projects, interior designers who work with Novatecture note that their homes are designed with furniture placement and home dcor in mind, creating a polished look. Engineers often comment on the ability of the company to complete a high-quality construction home, while incorporating the eye for even the smallest of design details. ',

He formed his first design and construction company in Tucson, Arizona in 1977. Larson completed his technical institute general contracting training in 1979 and opened his own construction company in Minnesota. In 1985, Tim and his family moved to Arizona where he founded a company specializing in residential custom cabinetry and carpentry. In 1990, Steege and Larson pooled their construction and design talents to establish La Casa Builders and the result was the creation of some of the most stunning homes not only in Arizona, but throughout the southwest.

Chadwick Homes founder, Chad Stultz, has over15 years of experience in the residential construction industry. Chad graduated from Baylor University with a degree in Real Estate and Entrepreneurship. Since then, he has worked in the new home industry for major corporate builders in the Houston area. Having gained experience in the fields of sales, finance, and construction of new homes, Chad offers quite an advantage over competitors. Being familiar with all sides of the new home business, Chad mentors homeowners throughout the complete home buying process by helping with financing and design questions, as well as pricing and budgeting questions, which allows them to achieve the best value possible. This knowledge makes our homeowners feel like part of our team when building their new home.
Chadwick Homes is not your typical homebuilder. Each and every home that is built is considered a Signature home, where the same amount of quality assurance and workmanship is guaranteed. For instance, Chadwick Homes prides itself in creating only 6 to 10 beautifully crafted homes per year, so that homeowners feel proud to live in a home of distinction and uniqueness. According to Chad, this is just the right amount of homes to manage in order to ensure complete satisfaction.
Most other homebuilders are also profit driven, whereas Chadwick Homes is driven by satisfaction and referrals. Providing quality homes is a labor of love, a business that is truly fulfilling for all who work here. If you were to ask Chad Stultz, president of Chadwick Homes, how to measure success, he would say, It is not about the money, it is about being passionate and enjoying what you do and taking pride in what you create, that will make you successful.
At Chadwick Homes, the vision of the future is very bright. As Chadwick Homes grows in size, so does our vision. We continue to expand our home designs and commit to enhancing our homes with the best products on the market without losing sight of delivering a superior home to our customers in quality, craftsmanship, value, and price.

The "Maven Experience" represents our response to a mostly self-serving industry. We are licensed consultants, not because the term "consultant" is a catchy title, but because we come from corporate backgrounds where service was our livelihood. To mishandle a client would mean losing their trust, and their business shortly thereafter. A consultant\'s success is based on a service-oriented approach to professionally deliver fact-based counsel, allowing the client to make informed, intelligent decisions. We bring those same disciplines to the real estate profession, and have expanded them to include the personal touch that comes with a transaction as emotional as buying or selling your home.',

The staff at Rockwell Homes knows that seamless architectural design based on your unique needs is our specialty. Listening to your individual desires and your family\'s future plans helps us build you a home of enduring worth that will bring you joy for many years; we build homes to fit the way you really live.

Even before construction begins you can be assured of our commitment to your ultimate satisfaction. Quality is always a top priority while we build your dream, and that is why we use high performing building materials: engineered foundations for strength, hurricane clips for safety, Trane or Lennox HVAC systems for comfort, Kool-Ply roof decking, double pane windows for energy efficiency, and high-speed Cat. 5 wiring for networking your home - things that you won\'t have to worry about because we\'ve already taken care of these details.
Putting it all together takes just as much expertise and craftsmanship as it does innovation and forethought. Rockwell Homes is proud to partner with some of the finest local trades people in the area to ensure that the same principles that we value are followed through to our specifications. Each subcontractor is hand selected for their reputation for high quality work and reliable service, and we make every effort keep your home building schedule on time and within budget.',

Since 2003, New Camden Homes has brought clients and leading architects together to create stylish yet functional homes that provide exceptional value, as well. Always seeking the perfect balance of style, custom features and value makes this possible. Our vision is a home that reflects the clients vision and respects the clients investment.

New Camden Homes has partnered with clients to build homes from close-in Bellaire to the rolling hills of Fulshear, on lots owned by clients and those owned by New Camden Homes. The end result is always a home that reflects vision, quality and exceptional value.

About New Camden Homes

New Camden Homes began in 2003 when Tim McGonagle took 20-plus years of experience in Houston-area home building and created his idea of what a custom homebuilding company should be  a thoughtful combination of vision, quality and value.

Drawing on experience in the field and in senior management with such companies as David Weekley Homes, Village Builders and Trendmaker Homes, hes built a company that works closely with clients throughout to the building process from design through completion.

There are New Camden homes in Bellaire, Houston, Spring Valley and Memorial, as well as in Richmond and Fulshear. Some were built on our lots, others on the clients lots, and were still that flexible.

Choose a New Camden Homes design and customize it as needed, or can bring your own plans. Our close partnership with several architects means we can help clients who have nothing more than a vision realize their dreams.

Theres even an option for those who dont want or dont have time for a design-and-build experience. Chances are we have homes under construction or almost complete available in Westin Lakes, a golf-course community in Fulshear.',

Having labored in the family retail furniture business, I moved on to earn an MBA at Rice, work for one of the last of the great Texas banks, Texas Commerce Bank, start and close my own retail furniture business, Oakcrafters, and then lease and manage a portfolio of Industrial properties which I still handle.

Each endeavor has shaped my thinking on business and allowed me to apply my knowledge to the craft of home building.

Itching for an entrepreneurial outlet, I bought a foreclosed house in the distant suburbs, cleaned it up and sold it.  I was a house flipper before the TV shows began to popularize it.  The process was fun and profitable for a while but ultimately unsatisfying.  The budget constraints meant that your highest aspiration was a clean and functional home.

I migrated closer to the city with an Oak Forest fixer upper that no one wanted.  Here I found a venue to create beautiful living spaces at a value that appealed to certain buyers.',

Built in 1961 near Philadelphia, PA., this iconic Mid Century house was designed by an architect who was trained by the famous Louis Kahn, one of the most influential modern architects in history.We renovated and restored the 2,500 sq. ft. residence back to its original splendor. Additionally we added a 65 x 8 cortan steel panel waterfall and reflecting pool thatcompleted the inside-outside demeanor of the house.
The house won Phillys prestigious \'Gold Brick"preservation award and has been featured several times in architectural media, The PhiladelphiaInquirer and has beenthe perfect backdrop location for several fashion photo shoots.',

This equates to over 190 completed homes worth over $250,000,000 in completed construction.
The reason for this success is simple. Every Abercrombie home attests to an uncompromising commitment to quality, from the use of the finest materials to the superior craftsmanship evident in every detail. Building a home is more that wood, nails, brick and mortar; it is also an expression of the owner\'s discriminating taste and distinct personality. That is why we form a close partnership with each homeowner, working with them through all phases of construction to ensure a home as individually unique as they are.
We are as meticulous about the cost of an Abercrombie home as we are about the design. We appreciate the sizable investment a home represents and take great pride in our reputation for precise bidding and cost-conscious performance at every level of operation. No other builder gives the quality and value for the dollar then Abercrombie Custom Homes, L.P.

                'descr' => 'Corbels business strategy has not changed since our first day of business, over 11 years ago. Simply put, we want to be the premier builder in the highest quality neighborhoods in Houston. As the owners, Mike and Nick Bregenzer have dedicated all of their time and energy into building the highest quality, most efficiently priced homes in the neighborhoods in which they both live. Since 2003, we have specialized in custom build to suit homes and remodels in Memorial, Tanglewood, West University, and Bellaire.


Our main approach is to partner with the customer on the front end of the project to assist with the plans, design ideas, and the budget. We have also been instrumental in securing and acquiring the hard-to-find home sites for over half of all customers. Working together with the homeowner, as a team, from the projects inception truly results in a home of a lifetime. The most important intangible benefit of selecting Corbel is that we are not just a spec home builder. The amount of expertise, communication, customer service, and dedication required to build a custom home versus building a spec home is immeasurable. We are probably one of the only premier builders in the area that can qualify as a true custom home builder. We have completed several spec homes and will continue that trend over the next few years. However, over 90% of our projects are custom homes.


The quality of home built, in Houstons most sought after neighborhoods, needs to be a highly custom product to protect the underlying investment in the land value itself. Based on this idea, most customers are going to want, and should expect, to deal with a builder who is involved from day one. Mike and Nick Bregenzer are both the owners and builders. At Corbel, we dont simply sell a construction package and then hand the work over to a superintendent. If we did that on every job, we would never have the overwhelming list of satisfied customers that we maintain. The owners are available to each and every one of our customers 24/7. Corbel Custom Homes is truly the only builder in the area that can boast of this claim.',

the best in design and expertise.
Granit Builders has risen to the challenge, with numerous projects under construction and
development in the Bellaire and West University areas. A sign of the market: four of these projects
are already under contract.
Each home Granit Builders builds is unique; this is the essence of a custom home.
From the time Granit Builders locates a building site to well after the owner has moved in, Marvin
Granit is involved personally. Engineering, design, construction management, cost control,
marketing need total attention to achieve the best possible product at the best price for the
homes owner.
During construction Marvin Granit is in constant contact with what he terms the team.
Building a home takes many types of expertise, said Granit. I have surrounded myself with the
best. My design consultant, has had years of experience in all aspects of construction and design.
While each house is under construction, Marvin Granit constantly is looking for input from his
architect and Realtors.
We work together to improve quality and incorporate the newest in design concepts. When the
house is sold, there is a constant follow-up to make sure the buyer is happy and satisfied.

Marvin Granit has been building and remodeling since he came to Houston more than 20 years ago.
He is meticulous when it comes to the finishing and design of his homes.  I believe strongly of
incorporating the newest technology and design into my homes.

Over the course of 30 years, he has held executive positions with some of the nations largest and most successful home building companies, and has maintained a passion for building homes for Texas families.
In 1988, Mark made a transition from the family business and took a position with the 7th largest builder in the nation at the time. Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by the founders of that company to join a new firm building larger and higher end homes. Starting out as a builder, he was quickly elevated to a project management role, maintaining sales and construction responsibilities for some of their largest and most successful projects.
Mark was later recruited to join one of the oldest and most successful Build on Your Lot companies in Texas in 1996. Starting out as a builder, he soon moved into a role as the Vice-President of Construction with the firm. Over the course of his tenure, he managed construction operations for the company state wide, and led their construction business through some of the largest growth and expansion in the companys history.
In 2006, Mark was recruited by a national Build on Your Lot builder to initiate their operations and lead their expansion into the Texas market. He established the companys regional administrative office, and developed two successful retail design centers in the Houston metropolitan market. He later assumed the management of the Louisiana and Arkansas operations, which were ultimately combined with the Texas Region to create what is now the South Central Region of the U.S. for the company. After a long career working with some of the nations most prominent home builders, he decided to start his own firm to return his focus to customer service.
Mark is a member of the Greater Houston Builders Association (GHBA), and was honored to serve as Chairman of the prestigious GHBA Codes and Standards Committee for 2006. He also holds the designation of Graduate Master Builder (GMB) as recognized by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
On a personal note, Mark and his wife Josette, reside in the North Montgomery County area. They are the proud parents of three grown children and two lovely granddaughters. They attend St. Joseph Catholic Church in New Waverly, Texas and enjoy traveling whenever schedules permit.',

And despite the awards he continues to earn for the caliber of homes he has built and the recognition and respect he has garnered in his industry, it is the long-term satisfaction of his clients - many of whom have become part of his expansive network of valued friends - that continues to drive him and define Morris Builders today.
Jim Morris is a Texas native who challenged industry standards when he began his company in 1992. Handshakes and barbeques best describe the manner in which he and his team have approached business. And it has proven successful. Jim Morris and his company have been spotlighted in such prestigious industry journals as Dream Homes of Texas, Luxury Homes of Texas and The Builder\'s Journal.
Hundreds of homes later, Morris has today become a recognized custom home builder and much more in the Montgomery County community. Morris is a search and recovery volunteer with the local constable\'s office and sponsors a number of local programs, including drug prevention in area schools. When Hurricane Ike hit the Texas coast, he and his team immediately began clearing debris from roads and yards - a response that earned his company the Heroes of Bentwater and Neighbor of the Year awards.
His commitment doesn\'t end when homeowners are handed the keys to their home. Morris and his team make a lifelong commitment - whether they\'re assisting with home modifications, or removing storm debris just because they have the equipment and manpower to do it',

I have been working in the construction business since I was 16 years old back in Brenham, Texas. I later moved to Houston and began working for a large homebuilder as a clean-up man. By working my way up to foreman, I literally learned homebuilding from the ground up. My on-the-job training taught me everything from form setting, concrete work and framing to final finish and inspections. Along the way, I discovered a knack for getting the best out of my fellow workers. This gift allowed me to become a production superintendent; running crews efficiently while maintaining high production. I later became the vice president of another building firm where I was involved with all phases of construction, business planning, sales and closings.
In 1960, my experience allowed me to start Precision Homes as a custom build on your lot homebuilder. Over the years I have learned a lot about building houses without losing sight of always putting the customers needs first. We understand what it takes to make a house a home and we want to earn your trust. I have a fine Team whose purpose is to make sure that we offer you a quality built home at an affordable price, designed to hold its value and last for years to come. I hope that you will give us the opportunity to help you realize your homebuilding dream.',

One of the principles Steve has learned over the years is that meticulous workmanship, together with experience, reduces time and makes it possible to adhere to an aggressive schedule and commit to an exact finished date.
Steve adds, "I take pleasure in caring for my clients, striving to exceed their expectations, not only during the remodeling process but many years after. I have the privilege of calling many of the clients I\'ve had throughout the years, dear friends."',

From $155,000 to over $1 Million, we put thirty years of experience into every home we build and we take personal pride in every house, regardless of budget. For most people, their home is their most valuable asset and deciding which home to purchase is a very significant decision. We understand the importance of this and recognize that our buyers have many options. That\'s why we pay such attention to design, materials, fit and finish --- and why and our projects are on time and on budget.
In 2007 we purchased 21 lots for development in a new age-restricted community in Bryan, Texas. Now we are perfecting homes for persons 55 and older. Conveniently located to shopping, government buildings, hospitals and restaurants, these home sites are selling fast.
Whether you are building or purchasing a new home --- or renovating the one you\'re in --- Tuscany Builders can deliver unmatched service, old world craftsmanship and intuitive design all in a professional environment intended to ensure your peace of mind. From conception to move-in, we\'re confident that you\'ll appreciate our hands on approach and the personalized service that we put in every step along the way.
